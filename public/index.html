      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
         Hangman is a game that my friends and I used to play in school.
         The way it is played is someone comes up with a word and writes down a blank space for every letter in the word.
         The player then guesses letters in the word, and if they are correct the appropriate blank spaces are filled with the letter.
         The game continues until the player gets all the letters in the word or they use up all their guesses.
         Each wrong guess is illustrated as a body part of the hangman.
         Once the whole body is drawn the game is over.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Guess only letters (case insensitive)</li>
         <li>You have 7 letter guesses</li>
      </ul>
